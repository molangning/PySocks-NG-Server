# PySocks-Server

Just another simple and easy to use python socks server.

## Usage

PySocks-Server is preferably used with [PySocks-NG](https://github.com/molangning/PySocks-NG), Another repository that I would be maintaining if things play out nicely.

## Hey! There is nothing here!

This repository is just a stub right now, I will expand it accordingly. For now, there will be a copy of the socks5 specification here.

<!--- Yes it is messy, I know that, We all know that --->
